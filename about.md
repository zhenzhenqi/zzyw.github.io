## Discourse

Discourse is an independent project initiated by artist Yang Wang and Zhenzhen Qi in Brooklyn, New York. Discourse is not merely a place for hour-long events, but also a space for playing video games, falling asleep, and sharing breakfast. With Discourse, conversation and discussions happen in any imaginable ways, not constrained by physical space and time. Discourse encourages natural and daily interaction and seeks to massage conversation into every corner of everyday life, instead of limiting thought exchanges in the form of analytical and reactive argument.
