ZZYW is a research studio based in New York and Brooklyn. It produces software application, installation, and text as instruments to examine the cultural, political and educational imprints of computational objects.

Since 2014, ZZYW has been maintaining a series of educational initiatives with universities and alternative spaces of learning, mining the potential of computation as a mode to express, speculate, and non-reduce. As an independent collective, ZZYW’s work has been exhibited in leading arts and culture institutions as Power Station of Art (Shanghai), the National Museum of China (Beijing), CultureHub (New York), among others.
