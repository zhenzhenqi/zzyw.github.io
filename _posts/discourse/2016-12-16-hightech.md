“High tech” would seem, at first glance, to be simply a matter of cutting edge technology. However, Martin Heidegger, a great Continental philosopher once discovered that in the Greek root of technology, Techne — is generally translated as “art,” “skill,” or “craft”.  The relationship between art and technology, visible in the Greek techne, has always been basic to technology and its “essence”. “Blinded” by the industrial revolution and capitalist movement, modern technology has been concerned solely with functionality – mechanical reproduction / controlling and being controlled.  Today, we start to see that once again, technology is being exposed to matters of representation, aesthetics, and style. The essence of technology becomes a matter of ongoing change or movement that is about “unsecuring”, “revealing” ,“unleashing” and “dismantling”. Its indeterministic, permeable, open-ended nature, just like the Greek Techne – Art.

We are excited to have **Amelia Winger-Bearskin**, **Jesse Harding** and **Yuxi Cao** join us for the night. They will share with us their experiments on “bewitching” modern technology, and bestowing “Low” tech with the enchanted aura of the aesthetic realm where it once belonged – “High” tech.
