> An art video game is like daydreaming – a dream that one can go back to over and over again. Objects within the Game are external manifestations of their creators’ spirits. While their creators are tied up with the reality of life, these tiny Objects awaken in this wondrous space of “grandeur” (Gustave Bachelard, 1948), brought to life through the imagination of the Game creators. They twist, turn, wiggle, roll around. On a sunny day, they wander within the Game land, make a friend, sing a song by the river. Gently, they bring together heaven and earth, and open their creators up to the future of reality.

> ThingThingThing is an experimental collaboration between Asia Art Archive in America and the artist duo ZZYW, formed by Yang Wang and Zhenzhen Qi. Participants spent two action-packed days at AAAinA, learning the fundamentals of video game development and making a collective art game along the way. At the end of the two days, the result is a film of the Game that generates its own plot in real time, created by all of the participants using Unity, a video game development platform, and C# as the programming language.
