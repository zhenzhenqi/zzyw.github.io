What is a game? What does it mean to talk about a game as a designer, gamer, or human being? Is it necessary to ask this question? What could we learn from the different answers each of us bring along?

To a game designer – the Ontology of Game is a topic that’s almost impossible to avoid. To a gamer, it’s also question that could be both tormenting and exiciting to think about.

The presenter would like to share his take on video game through the lense of Interactive Art and Design. He is also looking forward to learning more from your perspective.
