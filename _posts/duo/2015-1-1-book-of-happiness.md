A notebook, inside which a person’s happy memories are represented and analyzed using Statistical Regression Analysis and Parametric Design.

We interviewed a close friend of ours who has overcome more than a decade of struggle against depression. She lies down on a couch, and recalls 30 most difficult days during her journey. For each day she remembers, she rates her “sense of loss” and “level of internal struggle” on a scale of 1 to 10. We processed the data through a parametric design algorithm, generated 30 diagrams, laser cut into 30 individual pages, and manually bind them into a physical book.
