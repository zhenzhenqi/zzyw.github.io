Prism V.2 the movie is a non-interactive, generated film all scripted in Unity using C#.

棱镜V.2 是一个在Uinty中使用C#语言生成的非交互式的影片。

All objects are being generated out of algorithms and animated by functions in video game engine Unity. The final renderings are being transmitted to projection mapping softwares and then projected to walls and floor via multiple projectors.

There are multi versions of this project. The version for screen medium is using white as its world color and for the on-site projection version, we inverted the color map for a more immersive design.
