excerpt: ThingThingThing is a platform, and a generative narrative made collectively. Every object in the world of ThingThingThing is contributed by an individual. As oppose to commanding objects directly using a controller, ThingThingThing’s framework asks the contributors to code behaviors patterns of the objects using computer language. Once the objects are absorbed into the ThingThingThing world, they become autonomous, follows their logics and make decisions on the go completely by itself. The object would interact with other objects and forming an endless narrative as a whole.

### what is it

ThingThingThing is a platform, and a generative narrative made collectively. Every object in the world of ThingThingThing is contributed by an individual. As oppose to commanding objects directly using a controller, ThingThingThing’s framework asks the contributors to code behaviors patterns of the objects using computer language. Once the objects are absorbed into the ThingThingThing world, they become autonomous, follows their logics and make decisions on the go completely by itself. The object would interact with other objects and forming an endless narrative as a whole.

ThingThingThing explores the possibility of using open source platform as a way to make narrative collectively, in an effort to redefine what it means to co-create in the age of Internet.

物物物是一个平台，是一个算法生成的叙事，他的内容由网络的贡献者合作完成。物物物中的每一个物体都是由一位贡献者提交，而不同于传统的游戏模式，贡献者并非控制物体的每一个动作，相反的，贡献者使用物物物平台的工具，来设计和编程每一个物的智能和行为模式。在贡献者完成物的创造之后，这个物会被吸纳进入物物物的世界中，遵循设计者给他的行为模式，根据它的即使环境做出即使的验算，判断出下一步的行为，进而与其他物产生互动，构成一个封闭的、无限长度的叙事电影。

物物物使用了计算机工程师日常使用的平台Github，探索了使用开源平台公共创造艺术和叙事的可能性。艺术家希望通过这个作品，来尝试重新定义在互联网世代的“合作性创作”。

### workshops

Besides the artistic exploration, as a platform, ThingThingThing is designed to be an open world with an extremely accessible interface. It allows the creative, including those who are not from a technical background, to create their own sentient beings, with a simple framework design and developed by ZZYW, and put the beings they created into the world of ThingThingThing. The participants will not only get to know what ThingThingThing is, but leaving with the bare bone knowledge about video game making, the basics of computer programming and procedural thinking.

The list of institutions we have collaborated with:

- NEW INC, New York
- Macy Art Gallery, Teachers College, Columbia University;
- Creative Tech Week(CTW) New York 2018;
- Asia Art Archive in America
- Power Station of Art in Shanghai, China
