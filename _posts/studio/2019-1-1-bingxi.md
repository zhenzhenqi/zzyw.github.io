Figure Skating has been one of the most popular traditional winter-sports for the Northern China dwellers, it is especially a festival celebration for the Forbidden-city citizens. The Bing Xi Tu 冰嬉图 from Qing Dynasty shows us the grand celebration of how the ancient Chinese people enjoy this special winter activity.

清代皇家有腊月初八观看冰嬉的习俗。这里设计了蜿蜒曲折的空间。屏幕中，大雪漫天飞舞，来自《冰嬉图》中的古人正在冰上游戏。脚下，条条“冰痕”跟随观众挪移的脚步，相随相伴


#### How We Transformed the Painting:

Our designers traced the characters out from the original painting. Then, we used a complex computer algorithm developed by our technologist to animate the characters and to have them skating around following a very random but organic pattern.
