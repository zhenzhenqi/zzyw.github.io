###### Chief Curator of the Palace Museum experiencing the installation

**Client:**  *OUTPUT*(Shanghai) > *The Palace Museum* 故宫 (Beijing)

Exhibited at *the Palace Museum* at Beijing

We recreated one of the most well known painting collected by the Palace Museum,《岁朝图》. Employing modern day interactive technology, we infused life into the ancient painting, and brought it unprecedentedly closer to all visitor of the museum.

Everything on the painting becomes interactive, the flowers, the butterflies. fruits on the plate and the flying bees.

“岁朝”，即一岁之始，古指农历正月初一。“岁朝图”通常以静物画的面貌出现，将绘画与自然时序结合，通过画中物的谐音、寓意或掌故表现美好的新年祝福。本部分汇集故宫博物院典藏的多幅《岁朝图》所绘祥瑞之物，观众挥动手臂，蝴蝶飞舞，花枝摇曳，水仙与梅花纷纷绽放、各式吉果滚动，如穿梭在古人的岁朝图中，迎接新年来到。
