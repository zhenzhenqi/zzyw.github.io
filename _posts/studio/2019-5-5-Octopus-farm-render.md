We were reached by Prof. Jennifer Jacquet to create a title picture for her recent published research about the upcoming large scale, industrialized octopus farms.

This farm is envisioned from the not far future.

Read the report on Prof. Jacquet’s research on [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/12/octopus-farming-unethical-and-threat-to-food-chain)

> “Mass production would mean strictly controlled and monotonous environments, such as basic and sterile enclosures, constant environmental conditions, stringent diets and feeding schedules, all designed to maximize octopus biomass, not octopus well being.”

> —— Jennifer Jacquet

This is a more futuristic version that was produced as a side-design.
