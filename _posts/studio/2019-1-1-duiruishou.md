Making snow monster is another traditional winter activity in northern China, things are not different in the Palace Museum for the nobles. We took one famous painting 《乾隆帝岁朝行乐图》, and digitally re-created the fun activity, inside the Palace Museum of China, using modern day interactive technologies.

You could simply stand in front of the screen, wave your hands, and summon snow from the sky. The snow fall to the ground. The playing kids in the painting would gather your snow to pile, and help you making the snow monster.

特别设置的“堆瑞兽”交互体验，源于故宫博物院典藏书画《乾隆帝岁朝行乐图》中婴童堆雪狮子的场景。观众挥舞手臂，雪会从天空会飘落，而婴童也会逐渐堆好雪狮子、雪象和可爱的雪猫。观众挥舞幅度越大，瑞兽推起的速度也越快。亲身体验古代皇宫瑞雪丰年嬉戏游乐的欢乐。
