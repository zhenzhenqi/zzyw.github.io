The Creativity Machine is a computing system that produces graphic design on its own. The system is made of multiple software and hardware, including a custom written computer algorithm, running on a modern computer, a connected plot printer and a monitor displaying the design process.

The system is programmed to create graphic designs that follows the visual principle of the most popular International Typographic Style, often been called Swiss Style. This design style is being developed in the 1920s in Europe and later been widely adopted by American designers. Since then it has become one of the most popular design styles for all major cultural and arts institutions all around the world till today. A well-executed International Typographic Style design is often being associated with quality, creativity and esteem.

The Creativity Machine aims to create a surrealistic paradox. It looks familiar, human, organic, and even shines with modernism creativity; whereas its creative process is completely computed, its brain entirely mathematical, and its interpretation hardly comprehensible (to humans).

TCM是一个自动产生设计品的计算系统。这个系统由一些软件和硬件组成，包括一个专门的生产算法，运行在一台计算机上，一台工作室打印机，和一个显示器用来显示设计的过程。

TCM的系统被代码制定控制，它的设计遵循国际主义设计风格，也被人叫做瑞士风格。这种设计风格在1920年代在欧洲被创造出来，随后被美国设计师们广泛的使用。在当今它已经成为了最流行的设计风格，被主流的艺术和文化机构拥抱。一份完美执行的国际主义设计风格通常被社会认为是高质量、有创意、值得尊敬的。

TCM的目的在于创造一种超自然的悖论。这些产生出来的设计看起来很熟悉，很人文，很原创，甚至让人想到现代主义的创造力；但同时设计的过程却完全是计算出来的，它的大脑是完全数学化的，它的内容也几近无法被人类所理解。
