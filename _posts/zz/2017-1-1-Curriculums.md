### Art Game

This curriculum was originally designed for NMA3041 Baruch College, City University of New York, Fall 2018.

In this special topics course, students will create their own original Art Games: simple, conceptually based, and aesthetically beautiful interactive experiences. In this emerging form of new media arts, interactive narrative worlds are procedurally designed and developed by an artist and completed by the live input of players. Unlike commercial games that focus on entertainment, action, or combat, Art Games highlight interactive narratives and experiential scene design, emphasizing artistic expression, concept, and creative inquiry. Using the professional indie game development platform, Unity, students will learn fundamentals of computer programming, 3D modeling, character and scene design, cinematography, and performance. Projects may address system, agency, and negotiating the distance between self and other. Student projects created in Unity can be compatible with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). No prior programming experience is needed.

### Theory and Programming of Interactive Media II


This course is the second-level course in a sequence beginning with MSTU 5003. Students acquire advanced theoretical and technical knowledge needed to design and develop interactive web-based instructional applications grounded firmly in learning theory and design principles. The course is project-based whereby students delve into specific learning research to produce a theoretical model and well-aligned technical solutions. While the introductory course focuses on basic theory and technical implementation of instructional interactive media, Part II dives deeper into all aspects of the topic.

### Theory and Programing of Interactive Media I

Theory and Programming of Interactive Media I is the introductory course of a two course sequence (Theory and Programming of Interactive Media II). This course satisfies part or all of the programming requirements for several tracks within CMLTD. By the end of this course, students will be able to design and develop basic multimedia and interactive web-based applications backed by a rationale rooted in learning and media theories.

No prior knowledge of computer programming is necessary although it is highly advisable for students to be competent with the basics of computer systems (e.g. navigating file structures, working with different operating systems, etc.)

The primary language that we will use for the programming aspect of the course is JavaScript in conjunction with HTML/CSS. Note that this class is NOT a Flash programming language class as formerly known.

This course is concerned with three areas of software development:

1. Understanding and utilizing concepts of computational thinking and programming theory
2. Apply said thinking to design and build interactive learning experiences
3. Web Development through hands-on assignments and projects

### New Media New Form

A&HA 4089 |New Media New Form is part of the sequence of the Creative Technology Certificate program offered by Program in Art and Art Education, Department of Arts and Humanities, at Teachers College, Columbia University. I taught this course with the following curriculum during Spring and Summer semesters between 2016 to 2019. Other sections of the same course was taught by professor Richard Jochum from this department. Some resources presented in this curriculum also borrowed from professor Jaymes Dec’s Digital Foundation course curriculum.
