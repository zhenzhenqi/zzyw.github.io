<h3>About Raad studio</h3>
<p>Raad Studio is an award-winning Manhattan-based design firm with a portfolio of over 100 completed projects. Founded by designer James Ramsey in 2004, the firm specializes in the exploration of materiality, form and scale in a way that reveals the limitless potential of design, and that marries innovative thinking about function with a deep respect for the traditions of everyday living. Raad specializes in objects and spaces that emphasize the process of construction, an expertise gleaned from close and continued collaboration with builders. Our imaginative approach to design results in complex and layered projects with clean linear outcomes that lend themselves to open space as well as cozy enclosures and moments of connection. Raad Studio has received numerous design awards including the AIA 2015 Design Awards, the 2015 + 2016 Architizer A+ Awards, as well as from the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America for their work on The Lowline. Their work has been covered in more than 100 publications including The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, Metropolis, Monocle, and New York magazine.

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>Excited, being the designer for the redesign for Raad's site, we went for a minimalism and modern aesthetics for its new site. For the development, we choose Wordpress for its Content Management System to ensure an easy and stable maintenance. <a href="http://raadstudio.com" target="_blank">You can visit the site here.</a><p>
